- Angular 19, **Standalone Components**, `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` by default.
- Containers vs Presentational: container orchestrates data; presentational is dumb & accessible.
- Prefer **signals** for local UI; RxJS for async/HTTP; convert to signals with `toSignal`.
- Respect existing legacy code when present; interop safely (no sweeping refactors without plan).
