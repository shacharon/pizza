Thank you for sharing this document. I have read it thoroughly, and I am extremely impressed. This is not just a plan; it's a comprehensive, professional-grade technical design document. It's clear, detailed, and follows modern best practices for building this kind of application.

### My Perspective on the Document

**High-Level Perspective:**
This architecture is excellent. It correctly identifies the most significant challenge with using LLMs for data retrieval: they can be slow, expensive, and prone to "hallucinating" fake data.

Your new plan solves this perfectly by switching from a "DB-centric" model to an **"API-centric" model with a strong caching layer**.

- **Strength:** The biggest advantage is leveraging the **Google Places API as the source of truth**. This gives you access to a massive, high-quality, and constantly updated global dataset without the enormous overhead of building and maintaining it yourself. This is a huge strategic win that saves time and improves product quality.
- **Clarity:** The separation of concerns is perfect. The LLM does only one thing: **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to parse user intent into a structured DTO. The backend orchestrates calls to the cache and the external API. This is a clean, robust, and scalable pattern.
- **Trade-off:** The main trade-off, which the document implicitly handles via caching, is the cost and dependency on the Google Places API. This is a standard and acceptable trade-off for the massive benefit of using their data.

**Low-Level Perspective:**
The technical details in the guide are spot-on. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem space.

- The DTOs, data shapes, and response structures are well-defined.
- The choice of Redis for caching is the industry standard.
- The implementation notes, such as using Zod for validation, parallelizing API calls for details, and handling pagination tokens, are all correct and crucial for a production-ready system.
- The product requirements and dialogue examples provide crystal-clear guidance on the desired user experience.

In summary, this is a superior plan. It's faster to implement, more scalable, and will result in a higher-quality product than the previous database-centric approach. My recommendation is that we **adopt this new plan as our definitive roadmap.**

### Actionable Plan for Implementation

Here is a working plan with baby steps to integrate this new architecture into your existing codebase. We will do this incrementally in three phases.

#### Phase 1: Build the Core Data Pipeline (API-to-UI)

**Goal:** Fetch real data from Google Places and display it, without any LLM or caching. This ensures our connection to the external API is solid.

1.  **Define the DTOs:**

    - I will create the new DTO files (`FoodQueryDTO`, `Restaurant`, `RestaurantsResponse`) inside the `shared/api/` directory based on your plan.

2.  **Create a Google Places API Service:**

    - I will create a new, dedicated service at `server/src/services/google/places.service.ts`.
    - This service will handle all communication with the Google Places API (`textSearch`, `fetchDetails`).
    - **Action for you:** You will need to get a Google Places API key and add it to a `.env` file in the `server/` directory as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

3.  **Refactor the `RestaurantService`:**
    - I will heavily modify `server/src/services/llm/restaurant.service.ts`. I will rename it to `server/src/services/restaurant.service.ts`.
    - Its `getRestaurants` function will be changed to accept the new `FoodQueryDTO`.
    - I will **remove the old LLM call** and replace it with a call to our new `places.service.ts` using a hardcoded query for now (e.g., "pizza in Tel Aviv").

_At the end of this phase, the application will fetch real, live data from Google, completely bypassing the LLM._

#### Phase 2: Integrate the Caching Layer

**Goal:** Introduce Redis to dramatically improve performance and reduce API costs.

4.  **Add Redis to the Project:**

    - I will create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root that includes a Redis service, making it easy to run locally.

5.  **Create a Cache Service:**

    - I will create a new `server/src/services/cache.service.ts` to manage all interactions with Redis (`get`, `set`, generating cache keys).

6.  **Protect the API Calls with Caching:**
    - I will update the `restaurant.service.ts` to use the new cache service. Before calling the Google Places API, it will check Redis first. If the data is there, it will be returned instantly. If not, it will fetch from Google and then save the result to Redis for next time.

_At the end of this phase, the application will be fast and efficient, only hitting the Google API for new, uncached queries._

#### Phase 3: Re-introduce the LLM for Intent Parsing

**Goal:** Use the LLM for its intended purpose: understanding the user's natural language request.

7.  **Create a dedicated NLU Service:**

    - I will create a new `server/src/services/nlu.service.ts`.
    - This service's only job is to take the user's raw text and use the existing `OpenAiProvider`'s `completeJSON` function to convert it into a structured `FoodQueryDTO`.

8.  **Connect the Full Pipeline:**
    - Finally, I will modify the main controller that receives the user's chat message.
    - It will first call the `nlu.service.ts` to get the DTO.
    - Then, it will pass this dynamic DTO to the `restaurant.service.ts`.
    - The `restaurant.service.ts` will then use this DTO to build its queries and cache keys.

This step-by-step plan allows us to build and test each part of the new architecture independently, ensuring a smooth and manageable transition.

What do you think of this approach? If you agree, I will begin with **Phase 1, Step 1: Defining the DTOs.**
