You are correct. My apologies, it appears the tool I use to create files is not working as expected, and the `plan-review.md` file was not created for you. Thank you for your patience.

I will not try to create the file again. Instead, please create a new file at `shared/api/docs/plan-review.md` yourself, and paste the following content into it.

# Review and Implementation Plan for the New Architecture

This document contains a review of the architecture defined in `new-plan.md` and proposes a concrete, step-by-step plan for its implementation.

---

## 1. Architecture Review

The technical design outlined in `new-plan.md` is excellent. It is a professional-grade document that is clear, detailed, and aligns with modern best practices for building scalable, AI-powered applications.

My recommendation is to **fully adopt this new plan as the definitive roadmap** for the project's evolution.

### High-Level Perspective

The new architecture correctly shifts from a database-centric model to an **API-centric model with a strong caching layer**. This is a superior approach for this specific use case.

- **Key Strength**: Leveraging the **Google Places API as the single source of truth** is a massive strategic win. It provides access to a high-quality, global, and constantly updated dataset without the significant overhead of building and maintaining a proprietary database. This accelerates development, reduces maintenance, and ultimately leads to a better product.
- **Clarity of Design**: The separation of concerns is perfect. The LLM's role is tightly scoped to what it does best: **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to parse user intent into a structured DTO. The backend is a clean orchestrator of API calls and caching. This pattern is robust, scalable, and easy to reason about.
- **Accepted Trade-off**: The primary trade-off is the dependency on a third-party API (Google Places), which involves cost and potential rate limits. The plan correctly mitigates this with a robust caching strategy, which is the industry-standard solution.

### Low-Level Perspective

The technical details in the guide are comprehensive and accurate.

- The defined DTOs, data shapes, and response structures are well-thought-out and provide a clear contract for both frontend and backend development.
- The choice of Redis for caching is the ideal tool for this job.
- The implementation notes—such as using Zod for validation, parallelizing API calls for fetching details, and correctly handling Google's pagination tokens—are all crucial details that demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem domain.
- The product requirements and dialogue examples provide an unambiguous guide to the desired user experience, which is invaluable for development.

## 2. Actionable Implementation Plan

Here is a working plan with incremental baby steps to integrate this new architecture into the existing codebase. The plan is divided into three phases to ensure a smooth, manageable transition.

### Phase 1: Build the Core Data Pipeline (API-to-UI)

**Goal:** Fetch real data from the Google Places API and display it in the UI, completely bypassing the LLM and caching for now. This will validate our core connection to the external data source.

1.  **Define the DTOs:**

    - Create the new DTO files (`FoodQueryDTO.ts`, `Restaurant.ts`, `RestaurantsResponse.ts`) inside the `shared/api/` directory based on the schemas in the plan.

2.  **Create a Google Places API Service:**

    - Create a new, dedicated service at `server/src/services/google/places.service.ts`.
    - This service will encapsulate all communication with the Google Places API (`textSearch`, `fetchDetails`).
    - **Action Item:** A Google Places API key must be procured and added to a `.env` file in the `server/` directory as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

3.  **Refactor the `RestaurantService`:**
    - Rename `server/src/services/llm/restaurant.service.ts` to `server/src/services/restaurant.service.ts`.
    - Modify its `getRestaurants` function to accept the new `FoodQueryDTO`.
    - Remove the old LLM call (`completeJSON`) and replace it with a call to the new `places.service.ts` using a hardcoded query for initial testing (e.g., "pizza in Tel Aviv").

### Phase 2: Integrate the Caching Layer

**Goal:** Introduce a Redis cache to dramatically improve performance, reduce latency, and minimize API costs.

4.  **Add Redis to the Project:**

    - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root that includes a Redis service for easy local setup.

5.  **Create a Cache Service:**

    - Create a new `server/src/services/cache.service.ts` to manage all interactions with Redis (e.g., `get`, `set`, and generating cache keys based on the DTO).

6.  **Protect the API Calls with Caching:**
    - Update `restaurant.service.ts` to use the new cache service. Before calling the Google Places API, it will check Redis first. If a valid result is found, it will be returned instantly. If not, it will fetch from Google and then store the result in Redis for subsequent requests.

### Phase 3: Re-introduce the LLM for Intent Parsing

**Goal:** Re-integrate the LLM into the pipeline, but strictly for its intended role: understanding the user's natural language request.

7.  **Create a dedicated NLU Service:**

    - Create a new service at `server/src/services/nlu.service.ts`.
    - This service's sole responsibility is to take the user's raw text input and use the existing `OpenAiProvider` to convert it into a structured `FoodQueryDTO`.

8.  **Connect the Full Pipeline:**
    - Modify the main controller that handles incoming user chat messages.
    - The controller will now orchestrate the final flow:
      1.  Call the `nlu.service.ts` to get a structured DTO from the user's text.
      2.  Pass this dynamic DTO to the `restaurant.service.ts`.
      3.  The `restaurant.service.ts` will then use this DTO to build its cache key and API queries, returning fast, relevant, and real data to the user.
```

Once you have created that file, let me know, and I will proceed with **Phase 1, Step 1** of the plan: creating the DTO files.
