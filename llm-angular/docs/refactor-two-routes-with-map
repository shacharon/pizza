Excellent. This is a very clear and strategic direction. A "baby steps" approach is perfect for a refactor of this size. We will establish the new routing and folder structure first, ensuring everything still works, before adding any new features like the map.

Here is my proposed plan, broken down into small, safe steps.

### The Plan: Establish a Scalable Routing and Folder Structure

**Goal:** Restructure the application to support two distinct top-level routes (`/chat` and `/explore`), with shared components correctly placed in a `shared` directory.

**Phase 1: Create the New `basic-chat` and `explore` Feature Modules**

This phase is all about creating the new folder structure and routes, without changing any component logic yet.

1.  **Create New Directories:**
    *   `llm-angular/src/app/features/basic-chat`
    *   `llm-angular/src/app/features/explore`
    *   `llm-angular/src/app/shared/components` (for future shared UI)

2.  **Establish New Routing:**
    *   I will modify `app.config.ts` to set up the main application routes.
    *   The default route `/` will redirect to `/chat`.
    *   The `/chat` path will load our existing `ChatPageComponent`.
    *   The `/explore` path will load a new, placeholder `ExplorePageComponent` which we will create.

3.  **Move Existing Components:**
    *   I will move the `ChatPageComponent` and all its recently created child components (`results-table`, `summary-card`, etc.) into the new `features/basic-chat` folder. I will carefully update all the import paths to reflect this move.

**Pause Point 1:** At the end of this phase, the application will look and behave *exactly* as it does now. The only difference will be the URL (`/chat`) and the new, organized folder structure. I will stop here for your review.

**Phase 2: Identify and Move the First Shared Component**

This phase is about proving our shared component architecture works.

1.  **Identify a Candidate:** The `ResultsTableComponent` is a perfect candidate. The "explore" page will need a very similar list of vendors, even if the layout becomes card-based later.
2.  **Move to Shared:** I will move `results-table` from `features/basic-chat` into `shared/components`.
3.  **Update Imports:** I will update the `ChatPageComponent` to import `ResultsTableComponent` from its new shared location.

**Pause Point 2:** Again, the application will look and behave identically. We will have proven that both feature modules can successfully use a component from the shared directory. This is a crucial step for avoiding code duplication.

### Questions to Confirm Before I Start

1.  For the new feature folders, do the names `basic-chat` and `explore` sound good to you?
2.  For shared UI components, does the directory `shared/components` make sense? (We already have `shared/models`, `shared/pipes`, etc., so this feels consistent).
3.  Are you comfortable with me starting Phase 1 (creating the folders/routes and moving the existing chat components) right now?

I will wait for your confirmation before I begin making these structural changes.
