feat: implement structured logging with traceId + sessionId

Phase 1: Infrastructure + Search Orchestrator

INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES:
✅ Enhanced requestContext middleware with sessionId support
  - Extracts x-session-id header
  - Creates child logger: req.log = logger.child({ traceId, sessionId })
  - Added RequestContext interface

✅ Fixed HTTP logging middleware
  - Changed from req.path to req.originalUrl for consistency
  - Structured field names (method, path, statusCode, durationMs)

✅ Boot logging (server.ts)
  - Replaced 2 console.* with structured logger.info

CODE REFACTORING:
✅ Search Orchestrator (100% complete)
  - Replaced ALL 46 console.* calls
  - 43 console.log → logger.info/debug/warn
  - 2 console.warn → logger.warn  
  - 1 console.error → logger.error
  - All use structured JSON fields

CLOUDWATCH READY:
✅ Every HTTP request now has:
  - traceId (auto-generated or from x-trace-id header)
  - sessionId (from x-session-id header)
  - Structured JSON logs searchable in CloudWatch Logs Insights

REMAINING WORK:
⏳ ~200 console.* calls in 44 other files (see LOGGING_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md)

FILES MODIFIED:
- server/src/middleware/requestContext.middleware.ts
- server/src/middleware/httpLogging.middleware.ts  
- server/src/server.ts
- server/src/services/search/orchestrator/search.orchestrator.ts
- server/LOGGING_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md (new)

VERIFICATION:
See LOGGING_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md for:
- CloudWatch query examples
- Pattern reference for remaining work
- Full inventory of remaining console.* calls
